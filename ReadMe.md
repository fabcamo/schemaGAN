# Deep Learning for Geotechnical Engineering: The Effectiveness of Generative Adversarial Networks in Subsoil Schematization

## Description

This repository contains the code and results related to a novel Generative Adversarial Network application called SchemaGAN. SchemaGAN has been adapted from the Pix2Pix architecture to take Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data as a conditional input and generate subsoil schematizations.

For a detailed description and findings, please refer to the [official thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:c18cb6cf-3574-484d-aacc-dabd882341de).

**Keywords:** Deep learning, machine learning, generative adversarial network, schematization, cone penetration test, interpolation, stratigraphy.

## Results

After extensive testing and evaluation, SchemaGAN was found to outperform traditional interpolation methods (Nearest Neighbour, Inverse Distance Weight, Kriging, Natural Neighbour) as well as newer methods such as Inpainting. SchemaGAN results are characterized by clearer layer boundaries and accurate anisotropy within the layers. The superior performance of SchemaGAN is further confirmed through a blind survey, where it ranked as the top-performing method in 78% of cases as per experts in the field.
